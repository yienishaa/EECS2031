At break point 1
1: mainA = 1
2: mainB = 20000

At breakpoint 2

3: x = 1
4: y = 20000

for mainA and mainB : No symbol "mainA" in current context. and No symbol "mainB" in current context.
mainA and mainB are outside the swap function. Therefore while inside the function those variables cannot be accessed

At breakpoint 3

5: x = 20000
6: y = 1

At breakpoint 4

7: mainA = 1
8: mainB = 20000

for x,y No symbol "x" in current context. No symbol "y" in current context.
Again this is because x and y were variables of swap function. the 3rd breakpoint is inside main function. So while inside main function, local variables of swap function cannot be accessed.
